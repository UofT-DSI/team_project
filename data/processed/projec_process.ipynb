Civil twilight is the brightest form of twilight, providing enough natural sunlight for outdoor activities without artificial light. It’s often used for aviation, hunting, and street lighting regulations1.\n",
    "    - Nautical Twilight: Occurring when the Sun is between 6 and 12 degrees below the horizon, nautical twilight is less bright than civil twilight. During this phase, artificial light is generally needed for outdoor activities. Nautical twilight has historical significance for sailors who used stars to navigate the seas. It’s also relevant for military planning1.\n",
