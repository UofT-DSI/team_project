    "# Credit Card Approval Prediction : A Business and Data Analysis Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the financial services industry, understanding and predicting customer behavior is crucial for risk management and decision-making. This project focuses on analyzing the creditworthiness of clients using historical application and credit record data. The objective is to develop predictive models that can classify clients as 'good' or 'bad' credit risks. 'Good' credit risks are clients who are likely to meet their credit obligations on time, while 'bad' credit risks are clients who are likely to default or have overdue payments.This classification helps financial institutions in minimizing defaults while optimizing credit allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into model building, it's essential to understand the data at hand. The datasets used in this project include `application_record.csv`, which contains demographic and financial details of clients, and `credit_record.csv`, which tracks their credit history over time."

    "The application_df dataset includes key attributes such as gender, income, employment status, and the number of dependents, which are pivotal in determining the client's ability to repay loans. On the other hand, the credit_df dataset captures the client's payment history, which directly reflects their credit behavior. By merging these datasets, we can create a comprehensive view of each client that includes both their capacity to repay (from the application data) and their willingness to repay (from the credit data). The OCCUPATION_TYPE column has a significant number of missing values, which must be handled during preprocessing. These missing values could be filled based on other correlated variables or imputed using statistical techniques.\n",

For instance, clients with high income but poor credit history might be considered higher risk compared to those with moderate income and a spotless payment history.

For example, categorical variables like CODE_GENDER and FLAG_OWN_CAR are converted into numerical values through one-hot encoding. Additionally, the TARGET variable is created to indicate whether a client has had overdue payments, which will serve as the dependent variable in our predictive models.

These were selected to identify clients at higher risk of default, as each of these values corresponds to increasingly severe levels of delinquency.\n",

    "The analysis reveals that while both the Random Forest and Neural Network models perform well overall, they are not particularly effective at identifying 'bad' clients. This limitation is largely due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset, where 'bad' clients represent a small fraction of the total.\n",

    "For a financial institution, the ability to accurately identify 'bad' clients is crucial for risk management. The current models, while accurate overall, may not sufficiently protect against defaults. This insight underscores the need for model improvements, such as re-sampling techniques (e.g., SMOTE) or the implementation of custom loss functions that penalize false negatives more heavily. By doing so, the institution can better safeguard its financial health while still capitalizing on lending opportunities.\n",

Both the Random Forest and Neural Network models demonstrate high accuracy in predicting 'good' clients but fall short in identifying 'bad' clients. This challenge must be addressed to create a robust credit scoring model that accurately reflects the risk profiles of all clients."
